Welcome to my Doctors Office!  This is my RESTful application I have migrated to Amazon AWS. In the Backend I have SpringBoot(Java) that handling my REST calls to the frontend and DB. In the frontend I used Angular with bootstrap styling. For the DB I'm using Postgresql.

Cloud Specifics:
I have the Spring backend migrated to Amazon Elasticbean stalk, the Angular frontend migrated to an Amazon S3 server,
and my PostgresDB on Amazon RDS.
